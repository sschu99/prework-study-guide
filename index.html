      <ul>
        <li>HTML elements give structure to the content of a webpage</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage - metadata about accessibility, search engines and performance</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user - it is a HTML semantic element, where the name of the element describes its content/role</li>
        <li>For visible HTML elements, content is contained between an opening and closing tag</li>
        <li>HTML attributes define additional information about an element, defined in the opening element - eg. for the img element, src = source, alt = text that describes appearance/functionality of image</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
        <li>The footer normally contains information regarding the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
