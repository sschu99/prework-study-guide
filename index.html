      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML elements give structure to the content of a webpage</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage - metadata about accessibility, search engines and performance</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user - it is a HTML semantic element, where the name of the element describes its content/role</li>
        <li>For visible HTML elements, content is contained between an opening and closing tag</li>
        <li>HTML attributes define additional information about an element, defined in the opening element - eg. for the img element, src = source, alt = text that describes appearance/functionality of image</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
        <li>The footer normally contains information regarding the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to style using CSS - inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet and external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates hwo much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>* selector - rule applies to all elements visible on page</li>
        <li>For selectors with the same style, combine them in a single CSS rule with a comma in between - avoid repeating codes</li>
        <li>Link CCS file to HTML in the head element</li>
        <li>Class attributes allow different elements in HTML to share a CSS rule, by assigning rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
        <li>Adding font-family - font names with more than one word need to be surrounded by quotes</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git add -A: adds code in current working branch to staging area, which informs Git that these changes will be added to next commit</li>
        <li>git commit -m "commit name": creates commit to repository</li>
        <li>git pull origin main: to check if local branch is in sync with base branch in GitHub, pulls changes from base branch</li>
        <li>git push origin branch-name: push changes to remote branch</li>
        <li>In GitHub, compare and pull request - give a descriptive title and description of changes made</li>
        <li>To merge the code from the feature branch into the main branch, must designate the base branch as main and comparison branch as current working branch.</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code - declare a variable with let/var keyword, followed by the variable name</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script - in JS, code runs from top to bottom in a linear way</li>
        <li>Conditional statements are used to test if expression returns true or not</li>
        <li>Array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference - can store strings, numbers, boolean value all in the same array - these values go within []</li>
        <li>To access a stored data item in an array, you need to identify the index - arrays in JS are zero-indexed, in sequential whole numbers</li>
        <li>The for loop can perform a task on all items in an array, where the single code block is executed repeatedly</li>
        <li>The for loop contains 3 important statements:</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Determines the starting point for loop - where first index is always 0</li>
        <li>Condition - when no. in the variable x is less than length of array, loop will keep running</li>
        <li>Allows array to iterate over each item by writing x++, where the no. increases by 1 each time</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Code to be executed in if statements, for loops and functions are placed within curly brackets { }</li>
        <li>Functions are a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task - creates a reusable block of code</li>
        <li>Functions comprise of two requirements, firstly to define the function, and then call the function (to run/execute)</li>
        <li>When linking JS file to HTML, ensure the code is at the end of the body element</li>
