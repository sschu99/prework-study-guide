      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML elements give structure to the content of a webpage</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage - metadata about accessibility, search engines and performance</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user - it is a HTML semantic element, where the name of the element describes its content/role</li>
        <li>For visible HTML elements, content is contained between an opening and closing tag</li>
        <li>HTML attributes define additional information about an element, defined in the opening element - eg. for the img element, src = source, alt = text that describes appearance/functionality of image</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
        <li>The footer normally contains information regarding the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to style using CSS - inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet and external CSS style sheet</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates hwo much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>* selector - rule applies to all elements visible on page</li>
        <li>For selectors with the same style, combine them in a single CSS rule with a comma in between - avoid repeating codes</li>
        <li>Link CCS file to HTML in the head element</li>
        <li>Class attributes allow different elements in HTML to share a CSS rule, by assigning rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
        <li>Adding font-family - font names with more than one word need to be surrounded by quotes</li>

        <li>git add -A: adds code in current working branch to staging area, which informs Git that these changes will be added to next commit</li>
        <li>git commit -m "commit name": creates commit to repository</li>
        <li>git pull origin main: to check if local branch is in sync with base branch in GitHub, pulls changes from base branch</li>
        <li>git push origin branch-name: push changes to remote branch</li>
        <li>In GitHub, compare and pull request - give a descriptive title and description of changes made</li>
        <li>To merge the code from the feature branch into the main branch, must designate the base branch as main and comparison branch as current working branch.</li>
